This project is an exercise to learn blockchain basics.

First references should be:
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00196791">How to timestamp a Digital Document</a>
and
<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin.pdf</a>
which recyclyed the timestamp idea and helped explode the popularity of blockchain.

Also a good read, albeit a mix of bitcoin and blockchain, is the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#block-chain">bitcoin developer guide</a>
